Cassava is a key food crop grown by farmers is a woody shrub of the spurge family. It is 2nd largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa and a key food crop that can withstand harsh conditions, cultivated by 80% of household farms in Sub-Saharan Africa. But viral diseases are major sources of its poor yields.

We have trained a model that can take an image and classify it into 4 categories of disease and healthy as 5th category if it hasn't disease.

The four disease classes that model has been trained are 'Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)', 'Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)', 'Cassava Green Mottle (CGM)', 'Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)'
